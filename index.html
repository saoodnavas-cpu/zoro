     <h3><p>Roronoa Zoro, also known as "Pirate Hunter" Zoro,[9] is the master swordsman (剣豪, kengō?) and combatant of the Straw Hat Pirates, one of the Senior Officers of the Straw Hat Grand Fleet,[4] and is publicly recognized as the right-hand man and number two of his crew's captain, Monkey D. Luffy.[20][21][22][23] Formerly a bounty hunter,[6] he is the second member of Luffy's crew and the first to join it, doing so in the Romance Dawn Arc.[2]
Born in the East Blue, Zoro is the son of Tera and Roronoa Arashi, the grandson of Shimotsuki Furiko and Roronoa Pinzoro, and the grandnephew of Shimotsuki Ushimaru, making him a descendant of both the Shimotsuki Family of Wano Country and the legendary samurai, Shimotsuki Ryuma.[3][11] As a master of Three Sword Style, a swordsmanship style which he created during his childhood training in Shimotsuki Village, Zoro is one of the three most powerful combatants of the Straw Hats, alongside Luffy and Sanji, who are aptly referred to as the "Monster Trio".[24][25] His dream is to become the greatest swordsman in the world, to honor a promise he made to his deceased childhood friend and distant cousin, Kuina.[26]</p></h3>
